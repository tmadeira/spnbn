\chapter*{Abstract}

\noindent Sum-product networks are tractable deep models for probabilistic inference. In this work, developed during the course in \emph{Técnicas de Raciocínio Probabilístico em Inteligência Artificial}, we studied about sum-product networks, its probabilistic semantic and its relationship with Bayesian networks. We implemented an algorithm to convert a sum-product network into a Bayesian network in linear time in the size of the network. In this monograph, we present the theoretical foundations and the obtained results.
